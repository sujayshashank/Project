    <p id="para">The objective is to write a JavaScript program that enables an image to move according to the direction 
        specified by the arrow keys. The program must be able to recognize and respond to the input from the arrow 
        keys, and accordingly, update the position of the image on the screen. The program should be able to handle 
        the movement of the image in all directions, including up, down, left, and right, in a smooth and responsive 
        manner. Have a look at the event key codes before starting the project</p>
